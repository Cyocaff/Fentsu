    <center><h1>About this project<h1/></center>
    <h3>The reason for this project</h3><hr>
    <p>The Fentsu framework was made since I'm really against the idea of running Javascript on the server side,</p>
    <p>This framework uses jQuery for ajax and managing event listeners on resources_management.js.</p><br>
    <h3>The name</h3><hr>
    <p>Fentsu (フェンツ) was originally just the frontend I made for a project named Bentsu (ベンツ), since the frontend became way too complex
    I decided to separate it into another project, I thought that if Bentsu is the backend then the "B" sounds like backend right?
    then if I change it for "F" of frontend it's Fentsu.</p><br>
    <p>btw Bentsu is an alternate short name for 便利な勉強ツール, which translates to "Convenient Studying Tool".</p>
